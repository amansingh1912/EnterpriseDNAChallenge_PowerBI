## Objective:
My main objective was to prepare an exploratory analysis report about EDNA YouTube Channel Growth. It was quite interesting to analyze the dataset, apart from that I was provided 2 excel files with one excel file mentioning about the actual dataset which I am working with and the other file explaining about the dataset.
And, 1 pdf file explaining about the guidelines.

## Tools Used: Power BI, logomakr.com (for ready-made colored icons) and Figma ( for background )

## Steps Taken to Analyze the Data:
* According to the dataset, it was mentioned about different video IDs with their respective titles provided. So, I tried to analyze the dataset with respect to IDs and their likes, shares, subscriber gained, etc.
