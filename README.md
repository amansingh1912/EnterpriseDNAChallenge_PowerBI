## Objective:
My main objective was to prepare an exploratory analysis report about EDNA YouTube Channel Growth. It was quite interesting to analyze the dataset, apart from that I was provided 2 excel files with one excel file mentioning about the actual dataset which I am working with and the other file explaining about the dataset.
And, 1 pdf file explaining about the guidelines.

## Tools Used: Power BI, logomakr.com (for ready-made colored icons) and Figma ( for background )

## Steps Taken to Analyze the Data:
* According to the dataset, it was mentioned about different video IDs with their respective titles provided. So, I tried to analyze the dataset with respect to top video IDs with their likes, shares, subscriber gained, etc. via bar charts. It was the first part of the analysis which I named typically in the visualization as 
## Channel Analytics.

# Power BI - Channel Wise Analytics

* Another part of the analysis, which I analyzed according to the dataset was the year wise analysis of the channel growth on different aspects as mentioned like shares, subsriber gained, likes, etc. via area charts.
For this, as in the actual dataset, date was mentioned so by using the basic DAX function for finding year as mentioned below in the column, I made the Year column in Power BI as shown below.

I named the visualization for it as
## YearWise Analytics

# Power BI - Year Wise Analytics

* At the End, I made a 1 page visualization of the summary retrieved from the data.
Here, I used the simple DAX measures to find the sum of the different properties respectively and use them as cards in the summary.

I named this visualization as 
## Summary


# Power BI - Summary

## Design:
For the design part, I used one side pane as black color and plane purple background with graphs being shown on black background.
Also, for icons I used the logomakr site to fetch the icons and Figma for the plane background.

For the better visualization purpose of each pages namely "Summary", "Channel Analytics" and "Year Wise Analytics", I decreased the transparency of other icons in the visualization when one page is showing.


## Additional Features Used of Power BI:

In this visualization, I used the selection and bookmark property of Power BI to make the slicer panel responsive and page navigation to navigate through different pages.

## Conclusion:

Overall, in this challenge I came to know about different properties of Power BI and gave me a nice learning of it.
